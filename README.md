# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Project

This repository contains the work done for **Data Science Lab Project 2 (IASD)**, in collaboration with **Simon LiÃ©tar** and **Ilian BenaÃ¯ssa-Lejay**. The project explores **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and their variants, focusing on generating high-quality MNIST-like images.

## ðŸ“œ Summary
This project evaluates and improves various GAN architectures, including:
- **Vanilla GAN**: The baseline implementation.
- **WGAN**: Introduces Wasserstein distance for improved stability.
- **WGAN-GP**: Incorporates Gradient Penalty for enhanced training and better results.
- **Rejection Sampling**: Filters generated images based on Inception Scores to improve sample quality.
